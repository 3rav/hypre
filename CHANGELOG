Version 1.3.0b released, 2000/10/11.

- The number of threads to use in an OpenMP run can now be specified via
  either the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, or by the routine
  omp_set_num_threads().

- Added fortran interface support for compilers that mangle names with
  all capitals (e.g., Cray fortran compilers).  To use, specify the
  '--with-CFLAGS=-DHYPRE_CRAY' option on the 'configure' line.

Version 1.2.0 released, 2000/09/22.

Version 1.1.0 released, 2000/09/07.

- Setup time for PILUT has been dramatically reduced in the case of
  very small drop tolerances, and memory problems that were causing
  coredumps on >2 processors have been fixed.

- Changed Struct interface include file names to be consistent with
  the rest of the library.  They are now:

    HYPRE_struct_mv.h
    HYPRE_struct_ls.h

  The Struct library names have also changed similarly.

- Removed the `stencil' argument from `HYPRE_StructVectorCreate'.

- Added a new interface for semi-structured grids.  This is still very
  much a beta implementation, and should be used with extreme caution
  until further notice.

- The main header files have been restructured to be more readable.
  They will soon include full documentation for their interfaces.

New internal installation: V1.0.0, 2000/07/06

- Now installing both optimized and debugging versions of the library.
  The optimized library is in the usual place; the debugging library
  is in the subdirectory 'debug'.

- Added support for the FEI v1.4, with additional capabilities for handling
  parallel slide surface reduction and general Schur complement reduction. 

- Using a new version numbering scheme.  The C macro HYPRE_Version()
  may be used to retrieve version information.

New internal installation: V2000-05-31

- OpenMP threading added to BoomerAMG.

- Changed ParAMG names to BoomerAMG.  A script, 'hypre_update_boomeramg',
  is provided to convert code to use the new names.

- Changed default coarsening type for BoomerAMG.  This version does
  Ruge/Stueben coarsening on the interior of each processor to generate
  an initial independent set for the CLJP coarsening algorithm.

- Various BoomerAMG optimizations.

New internal installation: V2000-03-30

- New AddToValues and AddToBoxValues routines for Struct interface.

- Fairly extensive changes to SMG/PFMG codes to fix setup phase
  scalability problems.  These changes should result in slightly
  slower setup phase times for small-scale problems, but much
  improved setup phase times for very large-scale (greater than
  1000 processors) problems.

- AMG and GMRES solvers have minor fixes for reproducibility under
  restart.

- A subtle coarse grid operator bug in AMG was removed.  AMG no longer
  frees from an uninitialized pointer to an empty domain coarse grid
  operator.

- Minimum iteration count controls have been installed for AMG, GMRES,
  and CGNR.

- Fortran interface wrappers have been made for ParCSRMatrixMatvec and
  ParCSRMatrixMatvecT calls

New internal installation: V2000-01-14
