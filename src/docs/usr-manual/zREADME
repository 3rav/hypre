Issues and things left to do:

- MathJax is slow to render.  Are we okay with that?  Is there a better alternative?
- References need to be done
- Figure images need to be regenerated from original source files
- How to reference figures?
- How to combine images in a figure.  Create one PNG file from the combination?
- Copyright stuff, version numbers, other fine tuning...
