Issues and things left to do:

     - MathJax is slow to render.  Are we okay with that?  Is there a better alternative?
     - References need to be done
     - How to reference figures?
     - How to combine images in a figure.  Create one PNG file from the combination?
     - Copyright stuff, version numbers, other fine tuning...
DONE - Figure images need to be regenerated from original source files
