Brief guide to the AMS options available through the FEI
========================================================


1. Options that can significantly affect the performance

amsCycleType
   This parameter describes which sub-space solver variant to use.
   Default value: 1
   Other possible values: 11, 13, 5, 7, 8, 0
   Tips:
      - Cycle types 11 and 13 use a 4-space decomposition, which requires
        less memory but may not converge as well as cycle type 1. In many
        applications however, the convergence is good, and these options
        outperform (sometimes significantly) the default value.
      - Cycle types 5 and 7 are more robust versions of cycle type 1, use
        them when the AMS conjugate gradient convergence factors do not stay
        bounded below 0.9.
      - Cycle type 8 is an additive version of cycle type 1. This will give
        faster iterations but it may not converge without scaling (see the
        amsRelaxWeight and amsRelaxOmega options below).
      - cycle type 0 is a not a solver, but a Hiptmair-like smoother which
        is similar to, but faster than, diagonally-scaled conjugate gradient.

amsRelaxOmega
   This is a smoothing parameter for the edge-space smoother in AMS.
   Default value: 1.0
   Other possible values: between 0.0 and 2.0
   Tips:
      - The convergence can usually be improved by trying values other than
        1.0. For example 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7. The optimal value is
        problem specific however, and can change with mesh refinement.

amsAlphaStrengthThreshold/amsBetaStrengthThreshold
   These are options of the sub-space AMG solvers, affecting the measure of
   strong/weak connections.
   Default value: 0.25
   Other possible values: between 0.0 and 1.0
   Tips:
      - For problems with stretched elements or anisotropic coefficients,
        it is often beneficial to use larger values: 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9.
      - The larger the strength threshold, the more expensive each iteration
        is (and more memory is needed).

amsAlphaAggLevels/amsBetaAggLevels
   These are options of the sub-space AMG solvers, giving the number levels
   with aggressive coarsening.
   Default value: 0
   Other possible values: 1, 2, ...
   Tips:
      - If the convergence does not deteriorate significantly, aggressive
        coarsening will result in faster AMG iterations and somewhat reduced
        memory usage.

amsAlphaInterpType/amsBetaInterpType
   Which nodal-space interpolation operator to use in the sub-space AMG solvers.
   Default value: 0
   Other possible values: 6, 7
   Tips:
      - Interpolation types 6 and 7 identify long-range interpolation, which
        can be more expensive, but usually produces faster overall convergence.
      - To control the complexity, combine this with truncation (the amsPmax
        options below).

amsAlphaPmax/amsBetaPmax
   How to truncate the sub-space AMG interpolation operator.
   Default value: 0
   Other possible values: 4, 5, ...
   Tips:
      - Use with long-range interpolation.
      - Larger values lead to greater complexity and potentially improved
        convergence.

2. Additional options

amsNumPDEs
    Space dimension (3 for three-dimensional problems).

amsMaxIterations
    Maximum number of AMS iterations (1 when used as a preconditioner).

amsTolerance
    AMS convergence tolerance (0.0 when used as a preconditioner).

amsRelaxType
   Which edge-space smoother to use in AMS.
   Default value: "scgs"
   Other possible values: "scjacobi", "hybrid"
   Tips:
      - The "scjacobi" is faster per iteration, but usually converges much
        slower, so overall it is better to use "scgs".
      - The "hybrid" can potentially be better in certain applications.

amsRelaxTimes
   Number of edge-space smoothing steps.
   Default value: 1
   Other possible values: 2, 3, ...
   Tips:
      - Set this to 1, and instead change the cycle type (with amsCycleType).

amsRelaxWeight
   Damping coefficient for the edge-space smoother in AMS.
   Default value: 1.0
   Other possible values: between 0.0 and 1.0
   Tips:
      - Use this to rescale the preconditioner in additive cycle types, such
        as cycle type 8.
      - Can be combined with amsRelaxOmega.
      - Values greater than one may lead to divergence.

amsAlphaRelaxType/amsBetaRelaxType
   Which nodal-space smoother to use in the sub-space AMG solvers.
   Default value: "hybridsym"
   Other possible values: "hybrid"
   Tips:
      - The "hybrid" smoother is not symmetric, so it may lead to a diverging
        behavior in conjugate gradients. However, it is usually harmless to
        switch from "hybridsym" to "hybrid", in which case you may get a slight
        improvement in the overall solution time.

amsAlphaCoarsenType/amsBetaCoarsenType
   Which nodal-space coarsening scheme to use in the sub-space AMG solvers.
   Default value: "hmis"
   Other possible values: "pmis", "falgout"
   Tips:
      - The "pmis" coarsening is similar to "hmis".
      - The "falgout" coarsening is more expensive (and not scalable to large
        number of processors), but results in more robust solver that can solve
        the problem in fewer conjugate gradient iterations.
