To use this software, you need to go through the following steps :

1. obtain HYPRE, with HYPRE FEI that is FEI 1.5 compatible.

2. compile HYPRE, and copy the libHYPRE_LSI.a file to the lib directory

3. obtain FEI 1.5p1 source code, compile without any iterative solver libraries,
   and copy the .a file to lib/libfei_none.a

4. copy the mc.tar.gz file to your local machine (SUN workstation),
   unzip and untar it.  The 'start' program is the one to use when you
   want to visualize the grid.  Use it with the -v option in the parallel3D
   executable.

5. go into parallel3D, copy either makefile_west or makefile_blue to makefile
   (if you want to run on other platforms, you have to create your own makefile).
   Do an "make dd".

6. At the end when compilation and linking are successful, you will have the
   executable "dd_u" in your parallel3D directory.  Now you can follow the
   instruction in doc/userguide.ps to run it.

Note : if you are running on the blue machine, make sure you refer to the
       proper STL include files
