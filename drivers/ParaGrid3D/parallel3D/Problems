scaled.out - automatically reads file "myfile.out", scales with constant given
by "scale" and writes the output in file "scaled.out"


1. layer1.out
   This is mesh (1000, 500, 500). It was produced by netgen and scaled with
   scale.cpp. It has one horizontal layer (for z from 150 to 350). 
   Tetrahedrons in the layer are marked with 2.

2. bioscreen.out
   This is mesh (1000, 500, 500). It was produced by netgen and scaled with
   scale.cpp. It has several layers. The one that we use is for z from
   100 to 200. There are lines at 50 and 350 - may be used for giving
   boundary conditions. Tetrahedrons in the layer are marked with 1.
   Netgen used file bioscreen.geo, h = 1.

3. well.out
   This is mesh (1000, 500, 500). It was produced by netgen (file bdr_well.geo
   with h = 2.) and scaled with scale.cpp. The layer is as in problem 2. The
   elements in the layer have atribut equal to 1 and 2. For well we use the 
   line obtained by the intersection of planes y = 0 and x = 3.
