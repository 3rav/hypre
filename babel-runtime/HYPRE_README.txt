The file configure.ac has some changes to support hypre.  Search for
"hypre" to see the changes.

The file configure was generated from configure.ac with autoconf
version 2.52, patched to fix a bug as described below.

"make" in the top-leve hypre directory works (It does "make install"
in its subdirectories.)  "make clean" and "make mostlyclean" will
work once hypre is updated to use GNU standard targets.

On frost.llnl.gov, configure cannot find an include necessary for Java
without being told the path, with the configure argument
 JNI_INCLUDES="-I /usr/java130/include"
If it doesn't have that information, it should (but doesn't) disable
Java from the languages supported by the Babel runtime.
Consequently ... I have changed the configure.ac file to disable
Java in all cases.  Fortran90 is also disabled, as it also won't build
properly on Frost.

On frost.llnl.gov and probably other machines, the Hypre default C and
Fortran compilers are different from the Babel defaults.  The hypre
configure file does "export F77" and "export CC" to get the compiler
names into the Babel runtime configure script.

Also on frost and other AIX MP systems, the configure script in
babel-runtime should be run under nopoe, a script which forces
everything to be run serially on the interactive (login) node.
The system default version needs a slight change: where it writes a
file and stores the filename in an environment variable, instead store
the full pathname of the file.

The following fragment is generated by autoconf and appears in
configure.

do
  if (set +x; test -n "`(eval $as_var=C; export $as_var) 2>&1`"); then

The last line above is a bug (in autoconf; now fixed in their cvs
repository and the Babel group's version) and should be:
  if (set +x; test -z "`(eval $as_var=C; export $as_var) 2>&1`"); then
