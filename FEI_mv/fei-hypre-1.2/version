This is kind of a change log.

Version number convention is:
<major-release>.<interface-change(s)>.<any-update>

released version: 1.1.2, Sept 16, 1999

changes currently underway or recently finished:
-  enable the FEI to re-use the structural information from a
   single initialization pass, for the loading of multiple matrices
   for an aggregate (linear-combination of systems) solve.

-  some minor code enhancements, such as centralizing some common
   functions in the Utils class, etc.

-  fixed some sloppiness in the shared-node comm buffering that was
   using about twice as much memory as it needed to.

   put in the MPI_Type_free calls to avoid memory leaking from the
   custom types that the FEI registers with MPI.
 
-  Changed the constructor of the main implementation class, and
   renamed FEI_ISIS to FEI_Implementation. An instance of an FEI is
   instantiated using the ISIS_Builder class now. See the drivers.

-  Altered the C wrapper functions:
   Pre-pended FEI_ to all function names. 
      Additionally, the old 'numLinearSystems' is now 'FEI_create'.
      Also, the old 'destroyAllLinearSystems' is now 'FEI_destroy'.

-  (Keep adding changes here until an updated release is given to
    any customer.)

-  Completed a large set of changes on Nov 5: Removed the classes
      SharedNodeRecord
      ExternNodeRecord
      SharedNodeBuffer
      CommBufferInt
      CommBufferDouble
    and added the classes:
      EqnCommMgr
      NodeCommMgr
      ProblemStructure
      BCManager
    and renamed the classes:
      NodeRecord -> is now NodeDescriptor
      BlockRecord -> is now BlockDescriptor

   Also removed the need for MPI_NodePacket, MPI_NodeWtPacket, and almost
   all MPI code from BASE_FEI.

   The goal of these changes was to reduce memory requirements and probably
   increase performance by doing local assembly of remote equations, and
   creating the ProblemStructure class to enable the re-use of a single
   structure definition (result of an init phase) by several separate
   load phases.

released version: 1.2.0, Nov 8, 1999

- fixed a bug that was causing uninitialized-memory-reads in the
  boundary condition class BCManager.

released version: 1.2.1, Nov 22, 1999

- fixed a bug that was causing essential boundary conditions to not be
  correctly enforced for parallel runs. When the node that has the BC is
  in an element which touches a processor boundary, the other processor
  wasn't performing the column-wise operations for the boundary condition.
