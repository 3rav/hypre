To create a smoother/solver,

1. instantiate the solver agent

   solver = new MLI_SolverCreateFromID( id );
   solver = new MLI_SolverCreateFromName( name );
  
   where solver_id (solver_name) is one of :

      MLI_SOLVER_JACOBI (Jacobi)
      MLI_SOLVER_GS (GS)
      MLI_SOLVER_SGS_ID (SGS)
      MLI_SOLVER_PARASAILS (ParaSails)
      MLI_SOLVER_SCHWARZ_ID (Schwarz)
      MLI_SOLVER_MLS_ID (MLS)
      MLI_SOLVER_SUPERLU_ID (SuperLU)

2. call setParams to set specific parameters

   solver->setParams( param_string, argc, argv );

3. call setup

   solver->setup(MLI_Matrix *mat);

4. call solve

   solver->solve(MLI_Vector *, MLI_Vector *);
