To create a smoother/solver,

1. instantiate the solver agent

   solver = new MLI_SolverCreateFromName( name );
  
   where solver_id (solver_name) is one of :

      Jacobi
      BJacobi
      GS
      SGS
      BSGS
      ParaSails
      MLS
      CG 
      Chebyshev
      SuperLU
      SeqSuperLU

2. call setParams to set specific parameters

   solver->setParams( param_string, argc, argv );

3. call setup

   solver->setup(MLI_Matrix *mat);

4. call solve

   solver->solve(MLI_Vector *, MLI_Vector *);
