\chapter{A Glimpse at Future Directions}

In the future, there will be an interface to \hypre{} based on
a project at LLNL called ``Babel''. 
Babel is based on the concept of a Scientific Interface
Definition Language (SIDL).
The new interface will offer two major features:
automatic support for different language bindings, including
C, Fortran, C++, and in the future, potentially Java, scripting
languages, Corba/COM, etc.
The second benefit is that the new interface will provide an
object oriented model for \hypre{}, even though the bulk of
the library is written in C.

it is important to note that the new interface will not replace
the current interface but rather will be an additional interface.
Existing users should not be affected by the addition of the new
interface.

This chapter is for those users with OO experience, who are interested
in the object model that will be present in this view of \hypre{}.

{\bf Status:} As of February 29, 200, the interfaces to the structured
grid matrices and solvers are completed and are in testing, and implementation
of solver interfaces is underway. 

As of January 31, 2000, this interface to \hypre{}
is underway, with structured grids (matrices and solvers) under
beta development.
