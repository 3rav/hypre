\section{Building the Library}

Usually, \hypre{} can be built by simply typing \kbd{configure}
followed by \kbd{make} in the top-level source directory.

\subsection{Library configuration}

To automatically generate machine specific makefiles, type
\kbd{configure} in the top level directory.  The configure
script is a portable script generated by GNU Autoconf.  It runs a
series of tests to determine characteristics of the machine on which
it is running, and it uses the results of the these tests to produce
the machine specific makefiles, called `Makefile', from template files
called `Makefile.in' in each directory.  Once the makefiles are
produced you can run make as you would with any other makefile.

The configure script primarily does the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item selects a compiler
\item provides either optimization or debugging options for the compiler
\item finds the headers and libraries for MPI
\end{itemize}

The configure script makes these decisions based on a hierarchical
check.  First, it attempts to identify the machine on which it is
running as a specific supported machine.  Next it will try to identify
the architecture as a supported architecture.  If both of these fail,
generic default decisions are made by the script.  However, the script
does have some command-line options that can give you control over the
choices it will make.  You can type \kbd{configure --help} to see the
list of all of the command-line options to configure. This is the best
resource for information on configure options.  Below is some
additional helpful information.  Be aware that not all command line
options have been tested on all machines and architectures, even
supported machines and architectures.


\begin{description}

\item[--with- options] Each \kbd{--with-} option that is listed in
\kbd{configure --help} also was a \kbd{--without-} option (usually the
default, but not always).  Additionally, all \kbd{--with-} options
have a \kbd{--with-}{\it option}={\it pathname}.  This is not a
supported feature for all \kbd{--with-} options however and may have
no effect on configuration.

\item[Compilers] If you want to choose a compiler then is it recommended
that you choose all (C, C++, Fortran) compilers.

\item[Compiler Flags] To choose optimization or debug, use
\kbd{--enable-opt} (default) or \kbd{--enable-debug}.
For other compiler flags use the \kbd{--with-CFLAGS} option.

\item[BLAS] By default, configure attempts to find the systems native
optimized BLAS library.  The path for this library must be in the
user's \code{PATH}.  To specify another BLAS library available, use
\kbd{--with-BLAS=}{\it pathname} or
\kbd{--with-BLAS=}{\it link list}.  To configure and compile without
BLAS use the \kbd{--without-BLAS} option.
\end{description}

Configure automatically generates a file \file{HYPRE_config.h} that
includes all the header files found to be necessary by configure.
This file may be used to see how a compiled version of the library was
configured and may also be included by the user in his/her own code.

\subsection{Linking to the Library}

A program linking with \hypre{} must be compiled with
\kbd{-I\$HYPRE_DIR/include} and linked with
\kbd{-L\$HYPRE_DIR/lib -l}{\it hypre library name}... 
\kbd{-l}{\it hypre library name}..., where \kbd{\$HYPRE_DIR} is the
directory where \hypre{} is installed.  Additionally, any other
libraries to which \hypre{} is linked must also be linked to by the
users application.  For example, the BLAS library or PETSc library are
often (but not always) linked in by \hypre{} and would also need to be
linked in by the users application.

It may be useful to reference the \code{Makefile} in the \file{test}
subdirectory.  This makefile is designed to build test applications
that link with and call \hypre{}.  All include and linking flags that
are used by \hypre{} and needed by these test applications get
exported to this file by the \file{configure} script.

\section{Calling \hypre{} from Fortran}
\label{Calling hypre from Fortran}

Although \hypre{} is written in C, a Fortran interface is provided.
The Fortran interface is very similar to the C interface, and can be
determined from the C interface by a few simple conversion rules.
These conversion rules are described below.

Let us start out with a simple example.  Consider the following
\hypre{} prototype:
\begin{display}
\begin{verbatim}
int HYPRE_IJMatrixSetValues(HYPRE_IJMatrix  matrix,
                            int  nrows, int  *ncols,
                            const int *rows, const int  *cols,
                            const double  *values);
\end{verbatim}
\end{display}
The corresponding Fortran code for calling this routine is as follows:
\begin{display}
\begin{verbatim}
      integer*8         matrix, 
      integer           nrows, ncols(MAX_NCOLS)
      integer           rows(MAX_ROWS), cols(MAX_COLS)
      double precision  values(MAX_COLS)
      integer           ierr

      call HYPRE_IJMatrixSetValues(matrix, nrows, ncols, rows, cols,
     &                             values, ierr)
\end{verbatim}
\end{display}
The Fortran subroutine name is the same, unless the name is longer
than 31 characters.  In these situations, the name is condensed to 31
characters, usually by simple truncation.  For now, users should look
at the Fortran drivers in the \code{test} directory for the correct
condensed names.  In the future, this aspect of the interface conversion
will be made consistent and straightforward.

The Fortran subroutine argument list is always the same as the
corresponding C routine, except that the error return code \code{ierr}
is always last.  Conversion from C parameter types to Fortran argument
type is summarized in Table \ref{table-fortran-interface-types}.
\begin{table}
\center
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
C parameter & Fortran argument \\
\hline\hline
\code{int i} & \code{integer i} \\
\code{double d} & \code{double precision d} \\
\code{int *array} & \code{integer array(*)} \\
\code{double *array} & \code{double precision array(*)} \\
\code{char *string} & \code{character string(*)} \\
\code{HYPRE_Type object} & \code{integer*8 object} \\
\code{HYPRE_Type *object} & \code{integer*8 object} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{%
Conversion from C parameters to Fortran arguments
}
\label{table-fortran-interface-types}
\end{table}
Arrays arguments in \hypre{} are always of type \code{(int *)} or
\code{(double *)}, and the corresponding Fortran types are simply
\code{integer} or \code{double precision} arrays.  Note that the
Fortran arrays may be indexed in any manner.  For example, an integer
array of length \code{N} may be declared in fortran as either of the
following:
\begin{display}
\begin{verbatim}
      integer  array(N)
      integer  array(0:N-1)
\end{verbatim}
\end{display}

\hypre{} objects can usually be declared as in the table because
\code{integer*8} usually corresponds to the length of a pointer.
However, there may be some machines where this is not the case
(although we are not aware of any at this time).  On such machines,
the Fortran type for a \hypre{} object should be an \code{integer} of
the appropriate length.

%Fortran 77 subroutine arguments always pass copies of the argument
%addresses upon execution of the subroutine call.  This is referred to
%as call-by-address or call-by-reference.  In the called subroutine,
%the memory space at the argument address can be altered, but the
%calling address cannot be altered.
%
%C function parameters, whether pointers (addresses) or not, are
%directly copied upon entry to the function. This is referred to as
%call-by-value.  Altering the copied C parameter in the called function
%has no effect on the parameter in the calling function.  A pointer
%parameter in C can achieve the same effect as call-by-reference, and
%by this mechanism the languages can interoperate in a straightforward
%manner.
%
%Portability across typical platforms is currently achieved with the
%specific Fortran-calling-C mapping:
%
%\vspace{0.2in}
%
%\begin{tabular}{lcl}
%
%\underline{calling Fortran argument type} & &
%\underline{called C function parameter type} \\
%                              &                   &   \\
%\hspace{0.1in} (addr of) \code{integer*8}        & $\longrightarrow$ &
%\hspace{0.5in} \code{long int*} \\
%\hspace{0.1in} (addr of) \code{integer}          & $\longrightarrow$ &
%\hspace{0.5in} \code{int*} \\
%\hspace{0.1in} (addr of) \code{character}        & $\longrightarrow$ &
%\hspace{0.5in} \code{char*} \\
%\hspace{0.1in} (addr of) \code{double precision} & $\longrightarrow$ &
%\hspace{0.5in} \code{double*} \\
%
%\end{tabular}
%
%\vspace{0.2in}
%
%In particular, C-type
%\code{long int*} points to a space that can hold an address, a space
%which happens to be the size of that allocated by a Fortran
%\code{integer*8} declaration.
%In orther words, C can hold an address in a \code{long int} and
%assign that address to a Fortran \code{integer*8} memory space
%(using \code{long int*} call-by-value).
%
%Addresses in \code{integer*8} variables might not have originated
%in a Fortran call, and if they address inhomogeneously typed collections
%of data (e.g. C structures), Fortran might not have enough information to
%dereference them.  But Fortran can still pass around such addresses, and in
%particular hand them back and forth between various C functions.  The
%\hypre{} Fortran interface makes extensive use of this technique,
%as with the \code{addr} variable in the following general example:
%
%\vspace{0.1in}
%
%\noindent Generalized example:
%
%\vspace{0.1in}
%
%  Fortran calling:
%\begin{verbatim}
%      integer*8        addr
%      integer          intg, ierr
%      character        charact
%      double precision double_precis
%
%      call subroutine_name(addr, intg, charact, double_precis, ierr)
%\end{verbatim}
%
%The interface is designed so that the label \code{subroutine_name} is
%exactly the label of the \hypre{} C-function\footnote{For C function
%names under 32 characters in length, the Fortran name is the same as
%the C name.  For C function names over 31 characters, the Fortran name
%is condensed to less than 32 characters (see reference manual for
%Fortran name in such a case).}.  \hypre{} interlanguage C-wrappers
%currently account for interlanguage linking issues involving appended
%underscores.  The C-wrappers also accomodate Fortran subroutine name
%length limitations.  Fortran variable
%\code{ierr} allows error handling through the interface.
%
%\vspace{0.1in}
%
%\noindent Specific example:
%
%\vspace{0.1in}
%
%  Fortran calling:
%\begin{verbatim}
%      integer*8        IJmatrix, 
%      integer          num_nonzero_coefs, row_index
%      integer          col_indices(MAX_NUM_COLS), ierr
%      double precision coefs(MAX_NUM_COLS)
%             .
%             .
%             .
%
%      call HYPRE_IJMatrixInsertRow(IJmatrix, num_nonzero_coefs, row_index,
%                                   col_indices, coefs, ierr)
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\vspace{0.1in}
%
%  C called:
%\begin{verbatim}
%      int HYPRE_IJMatrixInsertRow( HYPRE_IJMatrix IJmatrix, int n,
%                                   int row, const int *cols,
%                                   const double *values)     
%
%      { int ierr = 0;
%              .
%              .
%              .
%
%        return(ierr); }
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\noindent Since the C function name has less than 32 characters, Fortran
%uses the same name in the subroutine call.
