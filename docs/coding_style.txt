These guidelines are based on those provided by the ISE project in CASC.
See /home/casc/software_development/docs for more info.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL GUIDELINES

The guidelines given in the ISE project document `coding_style.ps'
should be followed.  There are a few additions/changes that should
be made here:

  1. The "order of parameters" section should be modified so that
  opaque object names always appear first in the argument list.
  For example, a routine for setting the coefficients of a matrix
  object should look like

     HYPRE_SetMatrixCoeffs(matrix_object, ...)

  even though the matrix_object is an I/O parameter.  This is
  just to provide some consistency.

  2. Guidelines for indentation are given below.

  3. Guidelines for documentation are given below (well, they will be
  at some point :).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR HYPRE


 1. Functions and macros with parameters should be named as follows:

      HYPRE_MixedCase(...)          /* User interface routines */
      hypre_MixedCase(...)          /* Internal non-user routines */

 2. Macros without parameters should be named as follows:

      HYPRE_ALL_CAPS

 3. Types should be named as follows:

      HYPRE_MixedCase          /* User interface routines */
      hypre_MixedCase          /* Internal non-user routines */

 4. It is preferred that variables be named as follows:

      lower_casc_with_underscores

    This is not a strict rule, but in general one should try
    to adhere to this so that it is easy to distinguish variables
    from functions and macros.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

INDENTATION

  The ISE project file `sample.emacs' should be used to provide a
  common indentation style for the library.  If you don't use emacs
  as your editor, you can use the scripts written by Rob Falgout
  to indent files from the shell command line.  See the README file
  in `~falgout/tools'.

  The files `sample_c_code.c' and `sample_f77_code.c' have been
  provided as examples of indentation style for Hypre.  They are
  modifications of those provided by the ISE project.

  NOTE: the fortran source file and the fortran mode defined in
  the `sample.emacs' file do not agree.  The fortran part of this
  document needs work.  Volunteers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION

  DOC++ is to be used for documentation.  An initial document needs
  to be constructed here to get things started.
