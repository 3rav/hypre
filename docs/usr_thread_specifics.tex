\section{Thread Specifics}

\begin{description}
\item[Overview]
Hypre supports compiler directives and has pthreads available for use.  Either of these may be
used alone or with MPI.  When compiled with threads the default model is for 
hypre to use 1 thread per processor.  Currently threading is only supported
in the SMG code.  To use compiler directives, no code modifications are necessary-- simply use the configure option --with-openmp.  
Other platform specific information 
is available below.

\item[Platform Specific]
Pthreads are available but not supported on IBM Blue Pacific and DECS.  OpenMP compiler 
directives are supported on IBM Blue Pacific and DECS.  The default number of
threads per MPI process is 4.
