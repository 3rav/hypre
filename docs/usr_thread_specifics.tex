\item{Overview}
Hypre supports both pthreads and compiler directives.  Either of these may be
used alone or with MPI.  When compiled with threads the default model is for 
hypre to use 1 thread per processor.  Currently threading is only supported
in the ??? code.  
Other platform specific information 
is available below.
