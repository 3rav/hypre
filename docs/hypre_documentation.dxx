/** @name	Documentation Standards
  DOC++ is to be used for documentation.

  Example documentation for C routines can be found in the directory
  `struct_matrix_vector' in the files:

     DevManual.dxx
     communication.c

  Initial user's and developer's manuals need to be constructed in
  DOC++ to get things started.

  The above `.dxx' file could serve as a beginning developer's manual.
