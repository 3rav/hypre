\section{Code configuration}

To automatically generate machine specific makefiles, type
\kbd{configure} in the top level directory.  The configure
script is a portable script generated by GNU Autoconf.  It runs a
series of tests to determine characteristics of the machine on which
it is running, and it uses the results of the these tests to produce
the machine specific makefiles, called `Makefile', from template files
called `Makefile.in' in each directory.  Once the makefiles are
produced you can run make as you would with any other makefile.

The configure script primarily does the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item selects a compiler
\item provides either optimization or debugging options for the compiler
\item finds the headers and libraries for MPI
\end{itemize}

The configure script makes these decisions based on a hierarchical
check.  First, it attempts to identify the machine on which it is
running as a specific supported machine.  Next it will try to identify
the architecture as a supported architecture.  If both of these fail,
generic default decisions are made by the script.  However, the script
does have some command-line options that can give you control over the
choices it will make.  You can type \kbd{configure --help} to see the
list of all of the command-line options to configure. This is the best
resource for information on configure options.  Below is some
additional helpful information.  Be aware that not all command line
options have been tested on all machines and architectures, even
supported machines and architectures.


\begin{description}

\item[--with- options] Each \kbd{--with-} option that is listed in
\kbd{configure --help} also was a \kbd{--without-} option (usually the
default, but not always).  Additionally, all \kbd{--with-} options
have a \kbd{--with-}{\it option}={\it pathname}.  This is not a
supported feature for all \kbd{--with-} options however and may have
no effect on configuration.

\item[Compilers] If you want to choose a compiler then is it recommended
that you choose all (C, C++, Fortran) compilers.

\item[Compiler Flags] To choose optimization or debug, use
\kbd{--enable-opt} (default) or \kbd{--enable-debug}.
For other compiler flags use the \kbd{--with-CFLAGS} option.

\item[BLAS] The optimum BLAS for the platform should be obtained
without specification of a configure option.  In other words, by
default, the systems native optimized BLAS library will the
automatically chosen.  To specify another BLAS library available on a
platform, use \kbd{--with-BLAS=}{\it pathname} or
\kbd{--with-BLAS=}{\it link list}.  To configure and compile without
BLAS use the \kbd{--without-BLAS} option.
\end{description}

Configure automatically generates a file \file{HYPRE_config.h} that
includes all the header files found to be necessary by configure.
This file may be used to see how a compiled version of the library was
configured and may also be included by the user in his/her own code.

\section{Linking into another program}

A program linking with \hypre{} must be compiled with
\kbd{-I$HYPRE_DIR/include} and linked with
\kbd{-L$HYPRE_DIR/lib -l}{\it hypre library name}... 
\kbd{-l}{\it hypre library name}.
When using a formal \hypre{} installation, \kbd{$HYPRE_DIR} is
\file{/usr/apps/hypre}.
When using a private installation, the installer sets
\kbd{$HYPRE_DIR}.  Additionally, any other libraries to which \hypre{}
is linked must also be linked to by the users application e.g. the
BLAS library or PETSc library are often (but not always) linked in by
\hypre{} and must therefore be linked in by the users
application as well.  It may be useful to reference the Makefile in
the test subdirectory.  This Makefile is designed to build a test
application that links with and calls \hypre{}.  All include and
linking flags that are used by \hypre{} and needed by the application
get exported to this file by the configure script.
