\hypre{} uses Autoconf for installation.  For information on using
Autoconf in general, see
\begin{verbatim}
   file:/home/casc/software_development/html/index.html.
\end{verbatim}
See the User's Manual for details on building \hypre{}.

To move new code into the Autoconf system, a \file{Makefile.in} must be
created for each subdirectory containing code, and the names of the
subdirectories must be added to the list in the
\begin{verbatim}
   CASC_CONFIG_OUTPUT_LIST
\end{verbatim}
macro of the \file{linear_solvers/configure.in} file.

Anytime changes are made to either the \file{configure.in} or
\file{aclocal.m4} files, it is necessary to run \kbd{autoconf} to
generate a new \file{configure} script, and this new script must also
be checked into the repository.
