\label{Makefile Standards}

\hypre{} uses Autoconf for installation.  For information on using
Autoconf in general, see
\begin{verbatim}
   file:/home/casc/software_development/html/index.html.
\end{verbatim}
See the User's Manual for details on building \hypre{}.

To move new code into the Autoconf system, a \file{Makefile.in} must be
created for each subdirectory containing code, and the names of the
subdirectories must be added to the list in the
\begin{verbatim}
   CASC_CONFIG_OUTPUT_LIST
\end{verbatim}
macro of the \file{linear_solvers/configure.in} file.

\begin{verbatim}
New Makefile.in's may use the following macros from configure:

General purpose header files and libraries and directories for
those libraries 
INCLUDES  	produces a -I
LIBS		produces a -l
LIBDIRS		produces a -L

MPI-related header files and libraries and directories for those libraries
MPIINCLUDE	produces a -I
MPILIBS		produces a -l
MPILIBDIRS	produces a -L
MPIFLAGS	produces a -l

Macro definitions that should be included on compile line
HYPREDEFS	produces a -D
TIMERDEFS	produces a -D
HYPRE_PETSCDEFS produces a -D
HYPRE_PETSC_DIRS 

Libraries and their directories that must be used at compile time 
LDLIBS
LDLIBDIRS

Ranlib found by configure
RANLIB		will assign ranlib or maybe empty

Contain compiler flags such as optimization or debugging flags
CFLAGS		usually assigns -O or -g
CXXFLAGS	usually assigns -O or -g
F77FLAGS	usually assigns -O or -g

Needed when compiling with another command prior to the compiler command
for example: purify cc ....
PREPEND 	currently only used for purify


PETSC-related header files, libraries and directories for those libraries
PETSCLIBS	produces a -l
PETSCLIBDIRS	produces a -L
PETSCINCLUDE 	produces a -I

Needed for Petsc to locate hypre
HYPRE_TOP_SRC_DIR 

These may be referenced in a Makefile.in as follows:
  
	 CC=@CC@

This will replace ${CC} in your Makefile.in with whatever is assigned
to CC in configure-- perhaps gcc, mpicc, etc.

\end{verbatim}

Anytime changes are made to either the \file{configure.in} or
\file{aclocal.m4} files, it is necessary to run \kbd{autoconf} to
generate a new \file{configure} script, and this new script must also
be checked into the repository.
