\chapter{The IJ Linear System Interface}
\label{IJ}

The {\bf IJ linear system} interface is the lowest common denominator
for enumeration of an unaugmented linear system of equations to be
solved by {\slshape hypre} and cooperative packages.  It is designed
to insulate the user from underlying implementation details of sparse
linear system solvers.

An example of an augmented linear system is, for example, a linear
system plus the stiffness matrices from which the matrix coefficients
are assembled in a finite element discretization.  At the current time,
information about stiffness
matrices cannot be passed through the IJ interface. 

Use of the IJ interface implies that no underlying
assumptions are being made about the sparsity of the linear system. 
One would typically use the IJ interface to enumerate the linear
system originating from an unstructured grid PDE discretization.
However, the interface can be used for discretizations from more
structured grids, with consequent solver inefficiencies.  This
is because use of the IJ interface implies that solution
proceeds without sparsity assumptions.  Proceeding without sparsity
assumptions increases the expense of many matrix operations. 

IJ Matrix interface calls facilitate creation and destruction of 
interface abstracts, enumeration of rows and blocks of
linear system coefficients, and determination and querying of
underlying linear system data structure formats.  Hypre supports
multiple underlying data structure formats for unstructured linear
systems in order to cooperate with packages such as PETSc and ISIS, 
as well as for convenience to the {\slshape hypre} developer.
One current native support for unstructured linear systems is a
format abbreviated {\bf ParCSR}, meaning {\bf Par}allel
{\bf C}ompressed {\bf S}parse {\bf R}ow.  Another native support
is DistributedMatrix.

Currently, {\slshape hypre} solvers which operate directly on linear
systems passing through the IJ interface have either
ParCSR (interface) implementations, or DistributedMatrix
implementations.
