\section{ParaSails}

The ParaSails (Parallel Sparse Approximate Inverse, Least Squares) 
preconditioner is a sparse approximation to the inverse of the 
coefficient matrix.  It is applicable to symmetric positive definite
problems.  

\begin{display}
\begin{verbatim}
int HYPRE_ParCSRParaSailsCreate(MPI_Comm comm, HYPRE_Solver *solver);
int HYPRE_ParCSRParaSailsDestroy(HYPRE_Solver solver);
int HYPRE_ParCSRParaSailsSetup(HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_ParCSRMatrix A,
  HYPRE_ParVector b, HYPRE_ParVector x);
int HYPRE_ParCSRParaSailsSolve(HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_ParCSRMatrix A,
  HYPRE_ParVector b, HYPRE_ParVector x);
int HYPRE_ParCSRParaSailsSetParams(HYPRE_Solver solver, 
  double thresh, int nlevels);
\end{verbatim}
\end{display}

The accuracy and cost of ParaSails are parameterized by the real {\em thresh}
and integer {\em nlevels} parameters, 
$0 \le {\it thresh} \le 1$, $0 \le {\it nlevels}$.  
Lower values of {\em thresh}
and higher values of {\em nlevels} lead to more accurate, but more expensive
preconditioners.  More accurate preconditioners are also more expensive
per iteration.  The default values are ${\it thresh} = 0.1$
and ${\it nlevels} = 1$.  The parameters are set using 
{\tt HYPRE\_ParCSRParaSailsSetParams}.

Mathematically, given a symmetric matrix $A$, the pattern of the 
approximate inverse is the pattern of $\tilde{A}^l$ where $\tilde{A}$
is a matrix that has been sparsified from $A$.  The sparsification 
is performed by dropping all entries in a symmetrically Jacobi scaled $A$
whose values are less than {\em thresh} in magnitude.  The parameter
{\em nlevels} is equivalent to $l+1$.
For more details about the algorithm, see \cite{Chow:1999:APS}.

The storage required for the ParaSails preconditioner depends on 
the parameters {\em thresh} and {\em nlevels}.  The default parameters
often produce a preconditioner that can be stored in less than the 
space required to store the original matrix.
ParaSails does not need a large amount of intermediate storage in 
order to construct the preconditioner.
