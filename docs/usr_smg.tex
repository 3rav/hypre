\section{SMG}

SMG is a parallel semicoarsening multigrid solver for the linear
systems arising from finite difference, finite volume, or finite
element discretizations of the diffusion equation,
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot ( D \nabla u ) + \sigma u = f
\end{equation}
on logically rectangular grids.  The code solves both 2D and 3D
problems with discretization stencils of up to 9-point in 2D and up to
27-point in 3D.  See
\cite{SSchaffer_1998a,PNBrown_RDFalgout_JEJones_2000,RDFalgout_JEJones_2000}
for details on the algorithm and its parallel implementation/performance.

SMG is a particularly robust method.  The algorithm semicoarsens in
the z-direction and uses plane smoothing.  The xy plane-solves are
effected by one V-cycle of the 2D SMG algorithm, which semicoarsens in
the y-direction and uses line smoothing.
