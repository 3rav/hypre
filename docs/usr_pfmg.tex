\section{PFMG}

PFMG is a parallel semicoarsening multigrid solver similar to SMG.
See \cite{SFAshby_RDFalgout_1996,RDFalgout_JEJones_2000} for details
on the algorithm and its parallel implementation/performance.

The main difference between the two methods is in the smoother: PFMG
uses simple pointwise smoothing.  As a result, PFMG is not as robust
as SMG, but is much more efficient per V-cycle.
