/** @name Installing hypre

There are two types of hypre installations that are updated and
maintained by members of the Scalable Linear Solvers project:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The "internal" installation:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item intended to give users access to relatively recent changes.
   \item updated somewhat frequently (about once a week).
   \item may be relatively unstable.
   \item one old installation is retained.
   \item installed on:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item CASC Sun workstation cluster
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

\item The "external" installation:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item intended to give users consistent access across several platforms.
   \item updated less frequently than internal installation.
   \item should be relatively stable.
   \item a few old installations are retained.
   \item installed on:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item CASC Sun workstation cluster
       \item Compass DEC cluster
       \item Blue-Pacific
       \item Forest DEC cluster  (classified)
       \item Blue(Sky)-Pacific   (classified)
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

Rob Falgout is maintaining two lists of users who want to receive
notification of installation updates: one for "internal" updates and
one for "external" updates.  Users should send email to Rob at
rfalgout@llnl.gov to get on either list.

/** @name Installation Procedures

All installations are done with the #update# Bourne-shell script
located in the top-level directory of the hypre repository.  To
get general usage info, do #update -help#.
\begin{itemize}

\item Internal installation: (on CASC cluster only)
\begin{enumerate}

   \item Do #update internal# - this checks out the current version of the
   repository, tags it with a date (file #VERSION_DATE#), compiles it,
   temporarily installs it, and sets the permissions of the temporary
   installation to appropriate values.  This also creates the tar file
   #UPDATE.tar#, currently only used in the external installation.
  
   \item Do #update internal install# - this saves the previously
   installed version, moves the temporary installation into its
   correct location, and possibly deletes some older installations.
  
   \item Note that step 1 is not actually needed, but is recommended in case
   something doesn't work as planned (e.g., failed checkout, failed
   compile, ...).  Also, step 1 provides the opportunity to test the
   library in non-CASC codes such as ARES or ALE3D via the temporary
   installation in the #UPDATE# subdirectory.
  
   \item Send email to appropriate users indicating the update.

\end{enumerate}

\item External installation: (on CASC cluster)
\begin{enumerate}

   \item Do #update external#
   \item Do #update external install#

\end{enumerate}

\item External installation: (on all other supported machines,
e.g. the Compass cluster)
\begin{enumerate}

   \item FTP the file #UPDATE.tar# to west (for example), and put it
   in the install directory (do #update -dirs# for a list).
   \item Do #tar xf UPDATE.tar#
   \item Do #update external -dec #
   \item Do #update external -dec install#

\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
