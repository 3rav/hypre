The *_beam problem

   uniform long beam with force bc at end.  creates problems for iterative
   solvers


The *_sphere problem

   spherical shells problem.  slide surface.  the material
   in the center of the two shells is lucite and has a shear modulus
   approximately 3.e-2 that of the steel shells.

The *_block problem

   uniform cube.  velocity bc set so that material behaves elastically
   this can be changed by increasing the magnitude of the scaling factor
   in the .in file.
