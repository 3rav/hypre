File naming convention:  Files with uppercase: classes

all parser ops should be in Euclid_seq.h

euclid.h   -  the only file users need to include; this file merely
              include the other header files.

euclid_config.h  -  hopefully contains everything that may need to
                    be changed for interfacing Euclid with other
                    packages.

euclid_common.h  -  essential declarations used by all Euclid classes;
                    all global variables are also declared herein.

Euclid_seq.h   - the Euclid data structure (context) and supporting
                 functions for non-MPI compilations; "_seq" is a
                 misnomer, since this is also for OpenMP.
