<p>

This code solves a system corresponding to a discretization
of the biharmonic problem treated as a system of equations
on the unit square.  In other words, we solve 
Laplacian(Laplacian(u))x = f via
<p>
<center>  [ Laplacian   -I;   0  Laplacian] [ u ; v] = [ 0 ; f] 
</center>
<p>                   
For boundary conditions, we use u=0 and Laplacian(u) = 0.
<p>
The domain is split into an N x N processor grid.
Thus, the given number of processors should be a
perfect square.  Each processor's piece of the grid
has n x n cells with n x n nodes. We use
cell-centered variables, and, therefore,the nodes
are not shared. Note that we have two variables, u and v, and 
need only one part to describe the domain. We use the 
standard 5-point stencil to discretize the laplace operators. 
<p>                     
We incorporate boundary conditions as in Example 3.

We recommend viewing Examples 6 and 7 before this example.
